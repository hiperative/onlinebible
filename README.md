## About

Biblia Online is an application to help churches and religious organizations get rid of complexity.

We know that creating unique content ends up competing with basic tasks such making devotions, verses, comments, social networking nurture, and so many other day-to-day tasks available.

We believe that we can offer many of these services free of charge, with professional quality and focused on the word of God.
