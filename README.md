## About

Biblia Online is an open platform for building developer portals.

The philosophy behind Biblia Online is simple: Don't expose your engineers to the full complexity of your infrastructure tooling. Engineers should be shipping code â€” not figuring out a whole new toolset every time they want to implement the basics. Biblia Online allows you add "stuff" (tooling, services, features, etc.) by adding a plugin, instead of building a new tool. This saves you work and avoids the need of your team to learn how to use and support yet another tool.

## Getting started

To run the Biblia Online frontend, you will need to have the following installed:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Active LTS Release, currently v12
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Open a terminal window and start the web app using the following commands from the project root:

```bash
$ yarn install # may take a while

$ yarn start
```

The final `yarn start` command should open a local instance of Biblia Online in your browser, otherwise open one of the URLs printed in the terminal.
